## 📖 What is this guide?

In Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links, a **First Turn Kill (FTK)** is a strategy that allows you to defeat your opponent **on the very first turn**, without attacking or entering the Battle Phase.

The **Tindangle FTK** is one of the most complex and fragile FTK decks ever created in Duel Links. It relies on:

- Precise sequencing
- Graveyard setup
- Flip effects
- Link and XYZ summons
- LP manipulation using *Needle Ball* and *Agave Dragon*

This guide explains the deck **from start to finish**, including why it works, why it fails, and why it is not tournament-viable.
